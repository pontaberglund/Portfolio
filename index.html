                <h3>Java Snake</h3>
                <p class = "left-align-p">
                    This was my first ever graphical user interface (GUI) created using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)" class = "link">Swing</a>.
                    It is a very simple snake game with a basic GUI and it is quite bad looking. However I learned a lot 
                    and took some things to think about in my future Swing projects from it. You can try it by downloading the 
                    files from my Github to then compile and run the Main.java file.

                <h3>ChipKit Snake</h3>
                <p class = "left-align-p">
                    This was a school project for the course <a class = "link" href = "https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/IS1200?periods=6&startterm=20221&l=en">IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering</a>. The task was to create something
                    using the chipKIT Uno32 and a I/O shield with some buttons and an oled screen. Me and my partner <a class = "link" href = "https://github.com/Cactooz">Hugo Bachér</a>
                    decided to create a snake game to be played on the oled screen with the built in buttons. This project teached me programming on
                    a lower level using both assembley and C to communicate with the hardware.

                <h3>Swing Calculator</h3>
                <p class = "left-align-p">
                    This was my second try at creating a GUI using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)" class = "link">Swing</a>.
                    This time I wanted it to be more responsive and the screen size not being hard coded to a specific dimension.
                    The calculator itself works fine with simple math but once again the GUI is not very nice looking. 
                    The key take aways for me is that I learned how to think when creating a more responsive GUI and structuring the code nicely.
